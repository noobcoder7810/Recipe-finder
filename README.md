# Recipe-finder
A responsive web application built to allow users to search for recipes, view full cooking details (ingredients and instructions), and save their favorite dishes for later viewing.

This project demonstrates strong frontend skills in API integration, state management, routing, and modern UI design using Tailwind CSS.

üöÄ Key Features Implemented
Search Functionality: Users can search for recipes by dish name (e.g., "Pasta," "Chicken").

API Integration: Fetches real-time recipe data from TheMealDB API.

Recipe Details: Clicking a card navigates to a dedicated page showing comprehensive ingredients, measurements, and cooking instructions.

Favorites (Mid-Level Feature): Users can toggle a heart icon to save or remove recipes. Favorites are persisted across browser sessions using Local Storage.

Responsive UI: Fully adaptive layout using Tailwind CSS utility classes, ensuring optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
